# AcQM

For the parameterization of the EEQ model for the full actinide series, we created a set of actinide structures called AcQM.
In total, the set contains 2537 actinide structures.
Of those, 1283 are realistic actinide complexes with coordination numbers ranging from 4 to 10 and 1254 small mindless complexes with coordination numbers ranging from 1 to 8. 

### Contents

For every element, the various structures are in subfolders.
For every structure, the following is provided:

- Coordinates in xyz format (coord.xyz)
- Total charge (.CHRG)
- Number of unpaired electrons (.UHF)
- Hirshfeld partial charges obtained with wB97M-V/dev2-TZVPP, ma-def-TZVP for the actinides (hirshfeld.apc)
